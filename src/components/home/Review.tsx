      "My son had an allergic problem for four years. He had severe cough attacks. But after three months of treatment, he is fine now. Compared to allopathic medicines, the use of homeopathic medicines was also simple and easy. And the side effects of these medicines are also negligible.",

    review:
      "When I first visited different doctors, I was diagnosed with a fatty liver and a gallbladder stone measuring around 22 to 25 mm. Other doctors had advised me to go for surgery to remove it. However, Dr. Shumaila gave me hope and confidence by telling me that surgery wasn't necessary and that I could be treated with medication. Thanks to her treatment and guidance, I'm feeling much better without having to go through an operation. I'm truly grateful for her care and expertise.",

      "I had been suffering from sinus problems for a very long time. I visited many doctors and even went through nasal surgery, but unfortunately, my condition did not improve. Then someone recommended Dr. Shumaila to me. I decided to take her treatment and completed the full course as advised. Alhamdulillah, after finishing the treatment, my sinus problems completely disappeared. I am truly thankful and would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Shumaila for her effective treatment and support.",
